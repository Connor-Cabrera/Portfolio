			<p id="about">This message is at the heart of <b>Fitness Planet</b>. We firmly believe our services and expertise are one of those useful things<br> that should be absorbed.
			We were founded with the idea that knowledge is for everyone, which is why we provide such<br> helpful tools on our site for free.
			Don't think of us as just another gym, think of us as a <mark><em>path to a better you!</em></mark></p>
